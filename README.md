# basic-electron-app

This is a basic Electron app that is most useful as a template or starting point  
for building other Electron apps. It is essentially the same as the [Electrate  
template](https://github.com/mmick66/electrate) with a few small differences like app structure, coding style and setting  
up App.js as a pure functional component rather than a classical one.
